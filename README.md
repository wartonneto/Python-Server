# Python-Server
My first project using python

Usage: 

    1# Insert your .html file in any folder inside the project folder
    2# init server py file
    3# goto your browser and type localhost:8080/your-folder/anything.html in your URL bar of your browser

    Usage sample:

    localhost:8080/sites/teste01.html

Look, if you want to add css to your .html, use your <style> inside of the same .html .
